    <h3>About me</h3>

    <p>I am originally from Río Piedras, Puerto Rico. In this website, you can find information about my work, some of my personal hobbies, and other random and useless pieces of information.</p>

    <p>I am a Professor in the Department of Software and Information Systems in the College of Computing and Informatics at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. From July 2015-June 2019, I was Associate Dean of the College of Computing and Informatics. I served as a Faculty Fellow (2019-2021) at the Graduate School working on graduate funding and later in diversity initiatives. I am currently serving as Program Officer at NSF in the EWF Cluster.</p>

    <p>I graduated from la Academia Nuestra Señora de la Providencia in Cupey, Clase 80! Attended <a href="http://www.bsu.edu">Ball State</a> in Muncie, Indiana (David Letterman calls it the Harvard of Muncie) where I completed a B.A. and an M.S. Then I attended <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/">The George Washington University</a>, Washington DC where I completed my D.Sc.  I worked 6 years at the <a href="http://www.nrl.navy.mil/">Naval Research Lab</a> and did a 1 semester Visiting Professor at the <a href="http://www.usna.edu/">US Naval Academy</a>, Annapolis, MD. I taught 4 years at <a href="http://www.uprm.edu/">University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez</a> and then moved to <a href="http://www.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a> in 2000. I have been at UNCC since July 2015. During January of 2022, I was a visiting Professor at Northeastern, working in the <a href="https://cic.northeastern.edu/">Center for Inclusive Computing</a>.</p>

    <p>At Virginia Tech, I was Associate Dean of the <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/">Graduate School</a> and Director of the Office of Recruitment and Diversity Initiatives. I was also Associate Department Head and Director for Graduate Studies in the <a href="https://cs.vt.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>. I served in numerous committees and even a <a href="https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/95894">Provost Task Force</a>. I was a founding member of the <a href="http://www.hfsc.org.vt.edu">Hispanic Caucus</a> and a former chair of that group.</p>

    <h3>Wait! Two last names?</h3>
    <p>I have a writeup about why Latinos use <a href="twolastnames.html">two last names</a>.</p>

    <h3>How to write the accents</h3>
    <p>My name has "weird characters" according to people that have never left their house. If your software doesn’t allow you to copy/paste my name from anywhere in the site, you can type the characters directly as follows:</p>

    <table class="table table-striped">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>To get...</th><th>Mac OS<br>Type this</th><th>Windows<br>Type this</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr><td>é</td><td>Option-e followed by e</td><td>ALT key type 0233 on the numeric key pad</td></tr>
      <tr><td>ñ</td><td>Option-n followed by n</td><td>ALT key and type 0241 on the numeric key pad</td></tr>
      </tbody>
      <tfooter>
        <tr><td colspan="3"><em>On Windows, the character will appear when you let up the ALT key. If you don’t have a numeric keypad, then you should Google alternative ways to type accents with Windows.</em></td></tr>
      </tfooter>
    </table>

    <h3>Where are you from?</h3>
    <p>Depending on how you ask, I am Puertorrican, Caribe&ntilde;o, Hispanic, Latino or American.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, home of the happiest people in the world according to some studies (that are no longer linkable on the web).</li>

    <li>See "<a href="http://www.pbs.org/americanfamily/latino3.html">What it means to be Latino</a>" to get a better sense of the terms Latino, Hispanic, etc.</li>

    <li>There was a very <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/24/AR2006022400893.html">nice writeup in the Washington Post travel section (Feb 2006)</a> about Puerto Rico, done by four different writers each giving a different perspective of vacationing in Puerto Rico.</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Professional Recognitions</h3>
    <p>I have been fortunate and honored to be recognized for my efforts to increase diversity in computing.</p>
