<h3 id="sigcse-2022-workshop">SIGCSE 2022 Workshop</h3>

<p>The computing discipline is struggling to diversify its ranks. While we recognize the value of a diverse workforce, we often lack the language to discuss the issues. We even struggle to justify the benefits that might come from diversifying our ranks. This workshop presents concepts and frameworks about diversity with a focus on Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC). The workshop will be broken up into three parts. In part 1, What is Diversity, Equity and Inclusion?, we will provide some basic definitions and discuss how these concepts apply to BPC. We will expand the view of diversity by considering a multi-disciplinary perspective (e.g., scientific, educational, legal, business). In Part 2, Engagement with DEI concepts, the participants will get to have a candid conversation about different themes in diversity. Among the concepts discussed, we will explore issues of privilege, identity, implicit bias, micro aggression, stereotype threat, imposter syndrome, anti-racism, and, yes, even critical race theory. In Part 3, What can we do to improve DEI?, we will discuss why DEI is relevant to computing and why we should support the case for it. We will present a frameworks of diversity \&amp; inclusion, the inclusive excellence model (AACU). We explore how this model could be used in academic settings to make computing more inclusive.  While the bulk of the conversation will be about diversity in academic programs with particular emphasis on students, the topics discussed also apply to faculty hiring and are relevant to creating an inclusive culture in any organization.</p>

<!-- ###    Outline
1. What is Diversity? (30 minutes)
	* A quick introduction and broad definition of diversity.
	* Quick ice breaker to get all to be comfortable with each other
	* Discussion of the evidence in support of diversity from several disciplinary backgrounds: educational, legal, and business.
	* BPC Resources

2. Engagement with diversity concepts (1 hour 15 minutes, 15 minute break midway)
	* Privilege - What does it mean?
	* Implicit Bias/Associations - Definitions and examples from Project Implicit 
		<https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/>
	* Micro aggressions - discuss examples from <http://microaggressions.com/>
	* Identity - examples of issues in identity
	* Diversity Wheel - activities and discussion

3. What can we do to improve diversity? (30 minutes)
	* Why does it matter in computing (brief discussion)?
	* Broadening Participation in Computing Is Easier Than You Think 
		<https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/233339-broadening-participation-in-computing-is-easier-than-you-think>
	* Two frameworks for diversity (inclusive excellence & cultural wealth)
		* Recruitment, retention, and inclusion in our computing programs
