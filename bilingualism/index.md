title: Bilingualism in CS Education

# Bilingualism in Technology

My research group, in collaboration with professors in several other universities, has begun exploring the impact that being bilingual has on CS Education.

I presented the basic idea behind this research effort in my [**TEDxUNC Charlotte**](https://www.ted.com/talks/manuel_perez_quinones_why_i_want_my_voice_assistant_to_speak_spanglish) talk on bilingual issues in user interfaces. A follow up writeup, to appear in the ACM interactions magazine (_How the Ideology of Monolingualism Drives Us to Monolingual Interaction_ by 
Manuel Pérez-Quiñones and Consuelo Carr Salas), expands on the notion of the _ideology of monoligualism_ that makes a user interface in one language, and often English, the _norm_ and how that is contrary to how bilingual people interact and communicate. We have also submitted a panel proposal to the [RESPECT Conference](http://respect2021.stcbp.org/) where four of us discuss the implications that bilingualism has for inclusion in a technological society.

My research group has completed a first round of data collection with focus group of bilingual individuals. We are exploring how they have to adapt to technological limitations when they are engaging in bilingual exchanges.

In the upcoming year (2021-2022), we hope to accomplish the following:

1. analyze the data from the focus groups and prepare one or more publications,
2. collect new data in a locations where bilingualism is more prevalent than in Charlotte, NC,
3. formulate new ideas of how bilingual interaction with interfaces could make interaction easier for bilingual individuals,
4. build some initial prototypes in specific domains (e.g., news readers) and explore the impact of supporting fully bilingual interfaces.
