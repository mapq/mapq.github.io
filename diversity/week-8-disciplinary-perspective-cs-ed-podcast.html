<p>Listen to these three episodes. No class on Wednesday March 10th. Instead of homework and class, listen to these three podcast episodes. I will put a question under each for you to consider/ponder/reflect after you hear each episode.</p>
<p><strong>Season 2 Episode 1: Supporting students of color</strong><br>Dr. Manuel PÃ©rez-QuiÃ±ones from University North Carolina at Charlotte<br><a href="https://sites.duke.edu/csedpodcast/2021/01/04/season-2-episode-1-supporting-students-of-color/" target="_blank">https://sites.duke.edu/csedpodcast/2021/01/04/season-2-episode-1-supporting-students-of-color/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The very first question of the podcast, the definition of "students of color" and why they need our support, is worth thinking and understanding clearly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Season 2 Episode 3: Cultural Competence in Computer Science</strong><br>Dr. Nicki Washington from Duke University<br><a href="https://sites.duke.edu/csedpodcast/2021/02/01/season-2-episode-3-cultural-competence-in-computer-science/" target="_blank">https://sites.duke.edu/csedpodcast/2021/02/01/season-2-episode-3-cultural-competence-in-computer-science/</a><strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Think of Nicki's definition of cultural competence and why is it relevant for students as they graduate and enter the workforce?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Season 2 Episode 5: Systemic Change</strong><br>Dr. Leigh Ann DeLyser from CSforAll<br><a href="https://sites.duke.edu/csedpodcast/2021/03/01/season-2-episode-5-systemic-change/" target="_blank">https://sites.duke.edu/csedpodcast/2021/03/01/season-2-episode-5-systemic-change/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Leigh Ann's definition of systemic is wonderful. Think of what that means in our graduate programs, departments, or your own work environment (for those of you that have working outside of your graduate research). What do we need to make systemic change?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry to cancel class for this week. Too much going on. The <a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled" href="http://sigcse2021.sigcse.org/" target="_blank">SIGCSE</a> conference is next week and I have several roles I play that make me busier than usual. One of the things I am doing is <a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3408877.3432566" target="_blank">participating in a panel</a> with my two colleagues linked above and with Dr. Krsitin Stephens-Martinez on this very topic. I also have an exam in my undergrad course and several other professional commitments. That time of the year when we are all busy.</p>
