        <h3>About me</h3>

        <p>I am a Professor in the Department of Software and Information Systems in the College of Computing and Informatics at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. I am originally from Río Piedras, Puerto Rico. In this website, you can find information about my work, some of my personal hobbies, and other random and useless pieces of information.</p>

        <p>Starting in July 2019, I became a Faculty Fellow at the Graduate School in charge of the implementation of the Graduate Funding Taskforce. From July 2015-June 2019, I was Associate Dean of the College of Computing and Informatics.</p>

        <p>I graduated from la Academia Nuestra Señora de la Providencia in Cupey, Clase 80!  Attended <a href="http://www.bsu.edu">Ball State</a> in Muncie, Indiana (yes, where David Letterman studied) where I completed a B.A. and an M.S. Then I enrolled in <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/">The George Washington University</a>, Washington DC where I completed my DSc.  I worked 6 years at the <a href="http://www.nrl.navy.mil/">Naval Research Lab</a> and did a 1 semester Visiting Professor at the <a href="http://www.usna.edu/">US Naval Academy</a>, Annapolis, MD.  I taught 4 years at <a href="http://www.uprm.edu/">University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez</a> and then moved to <a href="http://www.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a> in 2000. Since July 2015, I have been at UNCC.</p>

        <p>At Virginia Tech, I was Associate Dean of the <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/">Graduate School</a> and <a href="http://graduateschool.vt.edu/diversity">Director of the Office of Recruitment and Diversity Initiatives</a>.  I was also Associate Department Head and Director for Graduate Studies in the Department of Computer Science. I served in numerous committees and even a Provost Task Force. I was a founding member of the <a href="http://www.hfsc.org.vt.edu">Hispanic Caucus</a> and a former chair of that group.</p>

        <h3>How to write the accents</h3>
        <p>My name has "weird characters" according to people that have never left their house. If your software doesn’t allow you to copy/paste my name from anywhere in the site, you can type the characters directly as follows:</p>

        <table class="table table-striped">
          <thead>
            <tr><th>To get...</th><th>with this OS...</th><th>type this.</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
          <tr><td>é</td><td>Macintosh</td><td>Option-e followed by e</td></tr>
          <tr><td>é</td><td>Windows</td><td>ALT key type 0233 on the numeric key pad</td></tr>
          <tr><td>ñ</td><td>Macintosh</td><td>Option-n followed by n</td></tr>
          <tr><td>ñ</td><td>Windows</td><td>ALT key and type 0241 on the numeric key pad</td></tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>On Windows, the character will appear when you let up the ALT key. If you don’t have a numeric keypad, then you might want to google how to type accents with Windows.</p>

        <h3>Wait! Two last names?</h3>
        <p>I have a writeup about why Latinos use <a href="twolastnames.html">two last names</a>.</p>

        <h3>Where are you from?</h3>
        <p>Depending on how you ask, I am Puertorrican, Caribe&ntilde;o, Hispanic, Latino or American.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, home of the <a href="https://www.tesh.com/articles/where-s-the-happiest-place-on-earth-it-s-not-disneyland-it-s-puerto-rico/">happiest people in the world</a> according to some studies.</li>

        <li>See "<a href="http://www.pbs.org/americanfamily/latino3.html">What it means to be Latino</a>" to get a better sense of the terms Latino, Hispanic, etc.</li>

        <li>There was a very <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/24/AR2006022400893.html">nice writeup in the Washington Post travel section (Feb 2006)</a> about Puerto Rico, done by four different writers each giving a different perspective of vacationing in Puerto Rico.</li>
