<h2>Course Specification Grading</h2>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
This is part of the Syllabus that I used in the ITIS 4440 course during the Fall 2020 semester. I have included it here as an example of how I explained specification grading to students. I mentioned this in the <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/csedpodcast/2021/01/04/season-2-episode-1-supporting-students-of-color/">Episode 1 of Season 2</a> of the <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsites.duke.edu%2Fcsedpodcast%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2Fseason-2-where-should-we-go-from-here%2F">CS Ed Podcast Season 2</a> and <a href="https://maperezquinones.medium.com/my-experience-with-specification-grading-fdf72c88c2fe">wrote a about it in my blog</a>. Hope you find it useful.<br>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>The grading in this class will be done in a way that is a bit different than you typically see in other courses. There are good pedagogical reasons why I am doing this, not doing it because I'm lazy or I have been under the influence of some suspicious substance. I'll tell you more about the reasons at the end, if you care to learn about it. Also, this is complex enough that I have recorded a video about this method (Linked at the bottom).</p>

<h4>Assignment Grade</h4>
<p>Each work your produce will be graded with a simple grading scheme of <strong>Satisfactory</strong>, <strong>Unsatisfactory</strong> or <strong>Not Submitted</strong>. That's it... ok, no, that is not it.&nbsp; What does each one mean? And how are these things translated to the university defined A,B,C,D,F system? Well, easy... here it goes.</p>

<p>We have several types of assignments in the course, CodeWorkout Workouts (seems redundant, no?), Homeworks, Technotes (which have several parts of its own), Programming assignments, and Exams. Each one will be graded as <strong>Satisfactory</strong>, <strong>Unsatisfactory</strong> or <strong>Not Submitted</strong>.</p>

<p>The table below shows how the three levels are computed. For most homeworks, getting an 80% is enough to be classified as Satisfactory. For programming assignments it is 70%.</p>

<p>To give you a sense of what this means, let us consider workouts. Workouts have typically about 8-10 coding problems. These are short coding problems, like write a function that looks for the smallest integer in an array. That coding problem is graded by 3-5 test cases. So if you figure 10 coding problems and 5 test cases for each problem, you have 50 "checks" in the assignment. So, to earn an 80% of 50 is 40 checks that you must get right. Or to think of it another way, you must get 8 of the 10 problems done perfectly and you can ignore the last two. Completing 80% of the work is considered <strong>Satisfactory</strong>. Completing less than 80% is <strong>Unsatisfactory</strong>. Not submitting anything is, eh, well, <strong>Not Submitted</strong>.</p>
<p>Did I mention that CodeWorkout problems are graded automatically and you can submit for grading many times? So, your goal is to keep working on this until you get to 80%. If you want to go for full glory, do it, but it doesn't affect your grade. 80% is enough to mark the assignment as <strong>Satisfactory</strong>. More after the table.</p>

<h4>Grade Bundles</h4>

<p>BUT, BUT, BUT, how does that translate to my good old friendly ABCDF grades? That is where <strong>grade bundles</strong> come in. You know when you buy things online, they sometimes offer you "bundles". Buy this widget and we will through this thingamagic for the same price.</p>

<p>Grade bundles are sort of like that. Your grade is based on how many assignments you have completed at the <strong>Satisfactory</strong> level. The A Grade Bundle requires that you complete all the CW Workouts, Homeworks, Technotes, 3 of the 4 programming assignments, and get an average of 90% for the exams. You at least that and you have an A.</p>

<p>The B Grade Bundle has 6 workouts, 6 homeworks, only 1 of the Video Technotes (but everything else of that category), 3 programming assignments and 80% average in the exams. And so on and so forth.</p>

<h4>Workouts</h4>

<ul>
	<li>There will be several code workouts in the course. These are all done with CodeWorkout. Each workout consists of 5-10 short programming problems. The problems are short, usually &lt; 10 lines of code each.</li>

	<li>The intent is for you to do these on a weekly basis so you are not overwhelmed at the end of the term. You have multiple attempts at getting each exercise done.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Homework</h4>

<ul>
	<li>There will be several small assignments in the course. Some of them are online quizes done in Canvas, others are simply outside of class readings followed by a short reading-comprehension quiz, others might be small interactive system explorations.</li>

	<li>All will have a stated due date and submitted through Canvas. Homeworks are either auto graded or will have a rubric indicating how they will be graded. You need 80% to reach <strong>Satisfactory</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>TechNotes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>This is a multi-part assignment, including a writeup, a video presentation, and 3 peer-reviews of video presentations.</li>

	<li>All TechNote submissions will be collected using Canvas.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Programming Assignments</h4>

<ul>
	<li>There will be 4 programming assignments in the course, all done in Java. More details for each project will be posted in the Canvas page. In general, you must submit Java code (.java files) that compile and run with Java 1.8. Submissions will be collected and graded with Web-CAT. The code must be well documented following the CCI Coding Style Guide.</li>

	<li>Note that there are 4 programming assignments and you have to complete 3 Satisfactorily to get an A in the class. This means that if one of your first three programming assignments is not completed to the Satisfactorily level, you can use the 4th as a replacement.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exams<strong></strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>Exams will be opened for 24 hours and will be online on Canvas. Once you start it, you will have 90 minute to complete the exam.</li>

	<li>The Final exam is optional and can be used to replace one of the other two exams. If your average of the other two exams is good enough for the bundle grade that ou</li>

	<li>The Final Exam is during final exam week - the university assigns the date and the professor is not allowed to change it. Do not plan a vacation before the final exam date. The final exam schedule will be available online.</li>

	<li><strong>YOU CANNOT skip any exam without a valid excuse.</strong> If you have a valid excuse that is <em>approved ahead of time</em> or have official documentation after the fact, then I will work with you to replace the score for the exam.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pedagogical Explanation</h3>

<p>This is not just some made up sh*t I learned in some retreat at a far away land. This is a fairly new approach to grading promoted by <a href="http://www.lindanilson.com">Dr. Linda Nilson</a> as described in her 2014 book Specifications Grading. There are some references below, in case you are interested in reading. The gist of the logic behind it is this:</p>

<ol>
	<li>With flexible deadlines and the ability of resubmit multiple times (because of automated grading and other technological marvels), students are provided with incentives to try to understand the material rather than beat the deadline. It removes the pressure of trying to get 100% on everything because the average of your grades will not determine your passing.</li>

	<li>It reduces time on the professor on grading because the professor won't have to justify the differences between a 75 and an 80 (and believe me that keeps me up at night). The professors just has to determine if the assignment is complete enough to be satisfactory or not. If it is not Satisfactory, the student gets to resubmit addressing the feedback of what is needed to improve assignment.</li>

	<li>In these difficult times, this grading approach seems better aligned with an online class. Most of the work in this class will be auto graded (workouts, programming assignments, some homework). As a result, you get to know right away "is this good enough?"</li>
</ol>
