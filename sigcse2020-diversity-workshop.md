## How to become fluent in diversity in one session
### SIGCSE 2020 Workshop #208 • Fri Mar 13, 2020 • 7:00 PM - 10:00 PM

<em>The 2022 Workshop is <a href="http://webpages.uncc.edu/mperez19/sigcse2022-diversity-workshop.html">here</a>.</em>

The computing discipline is struggling to diversify its ranks. While we recognize the value of a diverse workforce, we often lack the language to discuss the issues. We even struggle to justify the benefits that might come from diversifying our ranks. This workshop presents concepts and frameworks about diversity with a focus on Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC). The workshop will be broken up into three parts. In part 1, What is Diversity?, we will provide some basic definitions and take a quick tour of resources available for BPC. We will expand the view diversity by considering a multi-disciplinary perspective (e.g., scientific, educational, legal, business). In Part 2, Engagement with Diversity concepts, the participants will get to have a candid conversation about different themes in diversity. Among the concepts discussed, we will explore issues of privilege, identity, implicit bias, micro aggression, stereotype threat, and imposter syndrome. In Part 3, What can we do to improve diversity?, we will discuss why diversity is relevant to computing and why we should support the case for diversity. We present two frameworks of diversity & inclusion, the inclusive excellence model (AACU) and the cultural wealth model (T.J. Yosso). We explore how these models could be used in academic settings to make computing more inclusive.  While the bulk of the conversation will be about diversity in academic programs with particular emphasis on students, the topics discussed also apply to faculty hiring and are relevant to creating an inclusive culture in any organization.
